BOOTSTRAP! 

Week 9 at Promineo Tech I learned Boostrap and was challenged to create a 2 page site using HTML and Bootstrap. Additionally, the site needed a Nabar, Table and Form and our code needed to utilize Bootstrap Grid so that elements would stack vertically when the screen got smaller. 

I decided to create a recipe sharing site named Dish. I created a homepage with a "Featured Dishes" section and a "Submit" page for users to upload their favorite recipes. 
Both pages include a "Login" and "Create Account" button in the top right (with images I created on Canva to the left of each). The Navbar sits right below those images on both pages: with the current page in bold. The Navbar also includes a dropdown for Social Media links (graphics include). 

On the homepage, I also included a search bar so that users could find recipes. I put the featured recipes on cards and included links to the user who submitted the dish as well as a button to bring users to the full recipe of the dish. 

The Submit a Dish page includes a form for users to upload their recipes along with photos and videos. I made the photo and video uploads actually pull up the user's file explorer. Below the submission form I created a table that highlighted top dishes of the month. The table includes the recipe name, the name of the user who submitted the recipe, their username (with link to profile) and an image of the dish (when you hover over the image "click for full recipe" pops up for users to click and get the recipe. 

When the screen is small, the NavBar collapses and elements stack vertially. 

**It's important to note that this project was to implement Bootstrap and I was only 9 weeks into my coding journey, so there's no real functionality with the form submission or the search bar, etc.
